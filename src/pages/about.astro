    <!-- Why TCR Exists -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-medium text-stone-800 mb-5">Why This Exists</h2>
      <div class="prose-style space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Modern English Bible translations &mdash; the NIV, ESV, NASB, NLT &mdash; are under active copyright.
          Displaying them on websites, in apps, or in educational materials requires licensing fees or
          explicit permission. For most independent developers, educators, and researchers, that's a wall.
        </p>
        <p>
          The KJV is in the public domain, but its 17th-century English is a barrier for general readers
          and unsuitable for modern study tools. For over 400 years, there has been no serious, free,
          modern-English alternative that anyone can use without restriction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Covenant Rendering exists to fill that gap: a rigorous, formal-equivalence translation
          from the original Hebrew, released under CC-BY-4.0 &mdash; free to use, quote, distribute,
          and build on, with attribution.

    <section>
      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-medium text-stone-800 mb-5">Source Text</h2>
      <div class="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          The Covenant Rendering is translated from the
          <strong class="text-stone-700">Westminster Leningrad Codex (WLC)</strong> &mdash;
          the same authoritative Masoretic text used as the Hebrew source for the ESV, NASB, and most other
          modern translations. The WLC preserves the full vowel pointing (niqqud) and cantillation marks
          of the medieval Masoretic tradition, representing the most carefully transmitted form of the Hebrew text.
        </p>
        <p>
          All Hebrew displayed on this site uses the WLC text with full Masoretic pointing. The KJV is provided
          alongside each verse as a reference comparison &mdash; not as a translation source, but as a familiar
          benchmark for readers who grew up with it.

    <!-- Translation Philosophy -->

      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-medium text-stone-800 mb-5">Translation Philosophy</h2>
      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="p-6 bg-white rounded-xl border border-cream-200">
          <h3 class="font-serif text-lg font-medium text-stone-800 mb-2">Formal Equivalence</h3>
          <p class="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed text-sm">
            TCR prioritizes word-for-word correspondence to the Hebrew wherever natural English allows.
            This approach preserves the structure of the original text and enables readers to trace
            translation decisions back to specific Hebrew words. Where the Hebrew is ambiguous, TCR
            renders the most defensible reading and documents alternatives in the translator notes.
          </p>

        <div class="p-6 bg-white rounded-xl border border-cream-200">
          <h3 class="font-serif text-lg font-medium text-stone-800 mb-2">Reading Level</h3>
          <p class="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed text-sm">
            Target reading level is 9th&ndash;10th grade, comparable to the ESV. TCR does not simplify
            to increase accessibility at the expense of precision. If a concept requires a specific term,
            that term is used and explained in the key terms section. Readers should expect to learn,
            not be protected from the text.
          </p>

          <p class="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed text-sm">
            TCR is not affiliated with any denomination or theological tradition. Where the Hebrew text
            is genuinely ambiguous &mdash; and in the Hebrew Bible, that is often &mdash; both readings
            are presented and the tension is named. TCR does not resolve interpretive disputes in favor
            of any confession; it documents them.

          <p class="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed text-sm">
            Every verse includes translator notes explaining significant lexical choices, grammatical
            decisions, and points of scholarly debate. Key terms carry their Hebrew original,
            transliteration, semantic range, and a note on how the word is used in context.
            Nothing is assumed; nothing is hidden.

    <!-- AI Methodology -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-medium text-stone-800 mb-5">AI Generation &amp; Methodology</h2>
      <div class="p-6 bg-teal-50 rounded-xl border border-teal-100 mb-5">
        <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-teal-700 mb-1">Full Disclosure</p>
        <p class="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed text-sm">
          The Covenant Rendering was generated using Claude (claude-opus-4-6, Anthropic) via a
          carefully designed translation prompt. This is disclosed fully and without apology.
          The prompt, methodology, and generation parameters are available in the
          <a href="https://github.com/bashonda2/the-covenant-rendering" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-teal-600 hover:underline">GitHub repository</a>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          The use of AI does not diminish the scholarship. The translation was generated against the
          Westminster Leningrad Codex with explicit instructions for formal equivalence, transparency
          about interpretive decisions, and documentation of every significant lexical choice.
          The output was reviewed and the methodology evaluated.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI-assisted translation is a new frontier, and TCR is one of the first serious attempts to
          apply it systematically to a biblical corpus with full methodological disclosure.
          The precedent matters: scholarship requires transparency, not mystification.
